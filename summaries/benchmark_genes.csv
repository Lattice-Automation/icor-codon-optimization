FALVAC-1,** FALVAC-1 is a vaccine against Plasmodium Falciparum. This is a good benchmark for a synthetic gene as it is a real candidate vaccine that is recombinantly produced (Reference Paper).
PEA,"** Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA) is an important pathogenic factor 1. It retains high immunogenicity even after detoxification, enabling its use as vaccine adjuvants and vaccine carriers. This is a good benchmark as it can be produced for a low-cost at a large-scale in E. coli. Further, the (Reference Paper) finds that codon optimization enhances expression of PEA in E. coli -- thus, if the tool presented in this research can achieve similar/better results than the paper and/or other approaches, it will be considered an improvement."
msox,"** Monomeric sarcosine oxidase (Msox) is an important diagnostic enzyme and can catalyze the oxidation of N-methyl with the FAD cofactor. (Study) found that the expression of recombinant SOX ""has been extensively studied."" Thus, the sox gene serves as a good benchmark because the extent to which codon optimization affects it has been studied."
soxB,"** Sarcosine oxidase subunit B (soxB) is an important diagnostic enzyme and can catalyze the oxidation of N-methyl with the FAD cofactor. (Study) found that the expression of recombinant SOX ""has been extensively studied."" Thus, the sox gene serves as a good benchmark because the extent to which codon optimization affects it has been studied."
PRL-3/PTP4A3,** Protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3/PRL-3) is a well-documented protein that can be produced recombinantly in E. coli. This protein has been identified as a potential target to treat some cancers.
hPDF,"** Human peptide deformylase (hPDF) is a target for cancer therapeutics. However, its expression is not very efficient in E. coli. This serves as a good target for benchmarks as past studies have noted the valuable potential of codon optimization of this gene."
PF3D7,** Circumsporozoite protein is used as a surface antigen on the sporozite of a malaria parasite. It has been studied in papers that attempt to quantify gene expression.
PA,** Polymerase acidic protein (PA) plays a role in viral RNA transcription and replication. It is from the Influenza A virus. It has been studied in (codon optimization papers).
PIM1,"** PIM-1 kinase can be found in humans for signal transduction and the development of lymphoid malignancies. Studies have measured the expression of this gene in E. coli before, enabling suitable comparisons to be made 1 2."
